    "body": "We call the vulnerabilities we found “Fake Stake” attacks. Fake Stake attacks work because 3rd generation Proof-of-Stake blockchain implementations do not adequately validate network data before committing expensive resources, mainly disk-space and RAM. The consequence is that an attacker without much stake (in some cases none at all) can cause a victim node to crash by filling up its disk or RAM with bogus data. Unlike Cardano, many cryptocurrency blockchains that use the UTXO and longest-chain Proof-of-Stake model are susceptible to these Fake Stake vulnerabilities.
