## Introduction
***Are you a raspberry pi hobbyist or tinkerer? Do you want to know how to run a [Cardano node](/en/terms/cardano-node.md) on a [Raspberry pi](/en/identities/raspberrypi.md)?***

If you answered yes to any of the previous questions, check out our guide on getting a [passive Cardano node](/en/terms/passive-node.md) running on a raspberry pi 4. We go over the initial setup of the raspberry pi, how to boot from a USB storage device, and getting the Cardano node installed on the pi 4.

## Why this guide?

- This guide will walk you through step-by-step on how to setup a [Raspberry Pi](/en/identities/raspberrypi.md) Cardano Node by using a pre-configured version of the Raspberry Pi Operating System.

- If you rather use a different version of Linux OS here is a list of other guides we have made for other Linux OS:
  1. [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](/en/guides/run-a-cardano-node-using-a-prebuilt-image.md)
  2. [Alpine Linux OS](/en/guides/run-a-cardano-node-on-alpine-linux-os.md)
