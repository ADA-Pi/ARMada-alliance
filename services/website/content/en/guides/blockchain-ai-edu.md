##

One of the initial goals of PGWAD pool was to create educational videos on blockchain and AI. As part of that several videos on the project DeepchainADA was published in the Youtube channel. Taking a step further I decided to start a full series dedicated to basics of blockchain and AI. This is mainly to help participants become active developers in either or both fields. There are already several channels talking about this and why should I repeat it? The answer is that many of the videos are a bit dated and many times people find it difficult to understand and follow the topics. Sometimes the flow is missed when dodging the video playlists. Also blockchain like Cardano is fun to learn.

A right mix of balance is needed when both fields are in focus. Hence the video series will try to tackle these challenges. Another important point is that certain knowledge of mathematics is required. However the videos will cover all that.
In short the goal of this is that you will be able to write an AI agent and or smart contracts with Plutus.
Also if someone wants to learn on blockchain or only AI then that should also be possible. Once SingularityNet becomes available on Cardano you will be able to try out this also.
