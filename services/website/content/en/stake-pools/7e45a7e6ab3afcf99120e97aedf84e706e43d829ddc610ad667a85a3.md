## About US and Our Mission

PGWAD pool is a stakepool run by father and son. My son is still in learning phase. The best way to learn a blockchain is to start a node in the blockchain.
I was introduced to Cardano when I was studing about SingularityNet. I am an Artificial Intelligence (AI) researcher. My day job is do design Silicon focussed on harnessing ther performance/watt to train AI algorithms. The AI field is a centralized system. Big organizations control Data which is critical for success of an AI algorithm espcically Deep Learning. Hence SingularityNet was a breath of fresh air. It introduced me to the decentralized AI market place for first time. When I heard Ben Goertzel talk about Singularitynet on Cardano I was thrilled. I dont want to use the power of my GPU to mine ETH instead I want it to run my AI training. 

So here was a Cardano ecosystem that needed very less power to build a node. Once I started learning about Cardano, I was introduced the depth of research in Blockchain Proof of Stake. I got into so much depth that 6 months before I started this pool (in Jun-2021), I read all the reserach papers relating to Cardano. What did Cardano help me learn? 
1) Block Chain basics 
2) Ouroboros (classic,Praos, Genesis, Hydra, Chronos)
3) Networking:mini protocols
4) Stakepool operation
5) Functional programming (Haskell, Plutus)
6) Treasury and sustainability

My main focus right now is the AI+Blockchain. Specifically Look at this paper J. Weng, J. Weng, J. Zhang, M. Li, Y. Zhang and W. Luo, "DeepChain: Auditable and Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning with Blockchain-based Incentive," in IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, doi: 10.1109/TDSC.2019.2952332.

## Why is this important?

As you might have read, recently the bias in AI algorithms is causing havoc in people's lives. Many people lost their job because of a biased AI. All of this stems out of lack of data for AI training. Think of AI like your child. If you teach your child with bias they will learn with bias. So more data and diverse data can help. So we need a mechanism in which people can share data confidently. Isnt blockchain the solution for such a system?
Hence Privacy Preserving based Learning is the future. The paper implements Deepchain but I think the same paper can be implemented on Cardano with Smart contracts.

## About Stakepool

PGWAD ticker means Packet GateWay for AI and Decentralization.
The stakepool is run using Baremetal ARM raspi core and relays. There is a backup baremetal incase mains go offline. The whole system runs under 14Watt. We have Mac mini M1 and also other ARM SMB like Jetson Xavier on standby incase the furture needs of Cardano increase.  

We are also exploring Pi zero based hardware wallet using Trezor open source.

The main aim of the pool is to teach. The first student is my son. I plan to create training modules so that anyone can pick up blockchain and with right basic skills even AI. I plan to help interested people to start a node so that they can participate in the testing framework of Block chain and AI as part of DeepChainAda.
As we get more delegation and start to mint blocks, we will invest the profits back into the pool as a pledge increase or donating Hardware to people who want to start nodes. 

## Current Focus

Keep running the stakepool and focus on learning Plutus. I publish pool status every week and also the pool running cost and other details on twitter. Please follow me https://twitter.com/PgwadaS
I only update about the pool, cardano learnings and also AI & Blockchain.
I am currently building DeepChainAda using Plutus on Cardano.
The Idea is to connect this DeepChainAda to Idris which is the AI domain specific language that SingularityNet is planning to adopt.
======================================================
AI Agent -> AI DSL -> Idris => Plutus -> Haskell
======================================================
SingularityNet=> DeepchainSC on Cardano 
=======================================================

## Why Stake with PGWAD
PGWAD is investing in the future. Many things in Future like smart grid (for electricity distribution) will need the concept of Privacy-preserving and Auditable learning. So if you are intersted to understand how this area evolves then please follow us and if you can delegate to this pool please do. In Cardano the pool rewards are consistant when delegation is at 10Million or above. Until then the rewards from this pool will be sporadic (depending on stake in pool). We plan to keep investing in this pool (increase pledge, Hw etc) and also the task of AI+Blockchain.
