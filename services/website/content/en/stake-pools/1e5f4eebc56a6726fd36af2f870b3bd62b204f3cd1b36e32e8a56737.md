The block producer runs Asahi Linux on Apple Silicon, a future-proof Mac Mini M1 with 16 GB of RAM and 512 GB SSD. The communications between block producer and relay node located in Mexico are secured by Wireguard, a cryptographic VPN. This bare metal setup is powered by on-grid solar panels and was inspired by off-the-grid (OTG) pool by WCat, who kindly provided a second relay during migration, while TOKEN expands its low-powered infrastructure.
