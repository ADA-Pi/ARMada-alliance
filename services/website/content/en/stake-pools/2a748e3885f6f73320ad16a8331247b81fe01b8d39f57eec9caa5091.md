## About Berry

Berry was the first Raspberry Pi stake pool launched on Cardano and has one of the _**most vibrant Cardano Community**_. But its story doesn't quite stop there...!

Since the launch, Berry brought up a lot of innovative projects such as [Nami Wallet](https://namiwallet.io/), [Spacebudz](https://spacebudz.io/), a [NFT Metadata Standard](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-0025/CIP-0025.md) and many others tools that can be found on [Berry Github page](https://github.com/Berry-Pool).

By delegating to Berry, you can have a real impact on the Cardano ecosystem's growth.

## Our Mission

- Lower the entry barrier of decentralization by creating innovative tools and software.

- Promote and support energy-efficient and decentralized blockchain projects and operations.

## Stake Pool Hardware

- We are committed to operate on energy efficient hardware, therefore, we found that ARM base systems such as Raspberry Pi were perfectly suited for the task.

- While trying to keep everything minimalistic and with continuous improvement being part of our program, we are interested in exploring better ways of operating such as leveraging solar energy.

- Located in Munich/Germany and Alma/Canada, our relays are using 100Mbps, 500Mbs Fiber and mobile network connection to ensure fast block propagation and network connection resiliency.
