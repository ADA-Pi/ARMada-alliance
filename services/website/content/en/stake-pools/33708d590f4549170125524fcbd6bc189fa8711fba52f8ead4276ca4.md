## About Adaberry Pi

Owned and operated by the team of @DeZinerly (Barbara 'Sam' Samanich) and @DeCentN2Madness (Jeff 'Alice' Hales), the Adaberry Pi Cardano stake pool is devoted to true decentralization with a minimal impact on the world's natural resources.

### The Adaberry Pi Mission

The mission of Adaberry Pi is two-fold. We are committed to improving both the world's economy and ecology.

- **Solar Energy**: Our solar array in the Arizona desert provides more energy than our stake pool requires.
- **Carbon Sequestration**: To further minimize our carbon footprint, Adaberry Pi will be donating a portion of margin fees to [One Tree Planted](https://onetreeplanted.org/products/plant-trees).

One Tree Planted is our favorite non-profit 501(c)3 tax-exempt environmental charity organization. They plant one tree for every $US donated. Every month, they evaluate where in the world to plant trees for the most impact on our planet's ecosystem.

### Adaberry Pi Stake Pool Hardware

For reliable, low-power operation, every node making up the Adaberry Pi stake pool runs on the latest Raspberry Pi 4 model B with 8GB RAM. Booting from NVMe and SSD drives connected to the RPi USB3 ports, the block producing core node and its relays are backed up weekly to minimize downtime in the event of catastrophic failure.
