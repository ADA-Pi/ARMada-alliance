## Add extended metadata to your metadata file

Make sure to have the extended property defined in you metadata.json file.

```json
{
    "name": "Sublayer Pool",
    "description": "Providing marketing pages and educational content for stake pool operators.",
    "ticker": "SBLYR",
    "homepage": "https://pool.sublayer.io",
    "extended": "https://cdn.sublayer.io/poolExtended.json"
}
```

Example: https://cdn.sublayer.io/poolMetaData.json

**Note:** The extended property is not mandatory, but recommended for all metadata other than required by the Cardano network. If you don't have the extended metadata url specified and you're going to update the metadata.json file, make sure to regenerate the metadata hash and update your pool.cert file.

## Upload the extended metadata file

Make sure to specify `info.url_png_logo` and `info.url_png_icon64x64`. The Armada Alliance website will scrape this information and use it to display your logo.

  "info": {
    "url_png_icon_64x64": "https://cdn.sublayer.io/logo_64x64.png",
