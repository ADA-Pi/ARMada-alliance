## What is Nami Wallet?

Similar to [Metamask](/en/identities/meta-mask.md) on Ethereum, Nami wallet is meant to be the gateway for users looking to experience the vast ocean of [decentralized applications also known as DApps](/en/terms/dapp.md) that are being built on the Cardano blockchain. It can be used to send and store multiple assets, to delegate, to mint tokens, supports multi-sigs transactions, and much more. Smart contract support will be added when available.

Nami Wallet is a open-source project brought to you by the stake pool operators of [BERRY](/en/stake-pools/) pool, the first [Raspberry Pi](/en/identities/raspberrypi.md) based Cardano stake pool, and a founding member of the Armada Alliance.
