Please don't dominate the rap Jack <br>
if you got nothing new to say <br>
If you please don't back up the track  <br>
This trains got to run today

Spent a little time on the mountain <br>
Spent a little time on the hill <br>
Heard some say better run away <br>
Others say you better stand still

Now I don't know but I been told <br>
it's hard to run with the weight of gold <br>
Other hand I heard it said <br>
it's just as hard with the weight of lead

Who can deny? Who can deny? <br>
it's not just a change in style <br>
One step done and another begun <br>
in I wonder how many miles?

Spent a little time on the mountain <br>
Spent a little time on the hill <br>
Things went down we don't understand <br>
but I think in time we will

Now I don't know but I been told <br>
in the heat of the sun a man died of cold <br>
Do we keep on coming or stand and wait <br>
with the sun so dark and the hour so late?

You can't overlook the lack Jack <br>
of any other highway to ride <br>
It's got no signs or dividing lines <br>
and very few rules to guide

Spent a little time on the mountain <br>
Spent a little time on the hill <br>
I saw things getting out of hand <br>
I guess they always will

I don't know but I been told <br>
if the horse don't pull you got to carry the load <br>
I don't know whose back's that strong <br>
Maybe find out before too long

One way or another <br>
One way or another <br>
One way or another <br>
this darkness got to give <br>
One way or another <br>
One way or another <br>
One way or another <br>
this darkness got to give
