Please don't dominate the rap Jack \
if you got nothing new to say \
If you please don't back up the track  \
This trains got to run today

Spent a little time on the mountain \
Spent a little time on the hill \
Heard some say better run away \
Others say you better stand still

Now I don't know but I been told \
it's hard to run with the weight of gold \
Other hand I heard it said \
it's just as hard with the weight of lead

Who can deny? Who can deny? \
it's not just a change in style \
One step done and another begun \
in I wonder how many miles?

Spent a little time on the mountain \
Spent a little time on the hill \
Things went down we don't understand \
but I think in time we will

Now I don't know but I been told \
in the heat of the sun a man died of cold \
Do we keep on coming or stand and wait \
with the sun so dark and the hour so late?

You can't overlook the lack Jack \
of any other highway to ride\
It's got no signs or dividing lines \
and very few rules to guide

Spent a little time on the mountain \
Spent a little time on the hill \
I saw things getting out of hand \
I guess they always will

I don't know but I been told \
if the horse don't pull you got to carry the load \
I don't know whose back's that strong \
Maybe find out before too long

One way or another \
One way or another \
One way or another \
this darkness got to give \
One way or another \
One way or another \
One way or another \
this darkness got to give
