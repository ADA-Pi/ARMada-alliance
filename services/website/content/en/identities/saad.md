My name is Mohammad Saad Raza and I am a Software Engineer from Pakistan. I got into Cardano Stake Pool Operations when I got intrigued by the potential a decentralized infrastructure Cardano could provide. I work primarily with Web Applications and now I am also in the process of learning the Cardano Ecosystem using my existing skills and looking forward to learning new ones.
