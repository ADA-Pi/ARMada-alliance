My name is Steve Burg and I have been involved with Cryptocurrencies since 2014 and Raspberry Pis since their inception. The combination of the two as a low power consuption solution for Proof of Stake validation seems like the perfect solution to the power and ASIC arms race that has led crypto for the better part of a decade.
