SingularityNET is a full-stack AI solution powered by a decentralized protocol and the first and only decentralized platform allowing AIs to cooperate and coordinate at scale, removing one of the major limiting factors to AI growth today — the lack of interoperability — which severely restricts the ability to leverage the strengths and capabilities of individual AIs.

SingularityNET enables anyone to take advantage of a global network of AI algorithms, services, and agent. No longer must AI technology exist in silos, only capable of operating within a specific company, infrastructure, or industry.

Lead by [Dr. Ben Goertzel](/en/identities/dr-ben-goertzel), our team includes seasoned engineers, scientists, researchers, entrepreneurs, and marketers. Our core platform and AI teams are further complemented by specialized teams devoted to application areas such as robotics and biomedical AI.
