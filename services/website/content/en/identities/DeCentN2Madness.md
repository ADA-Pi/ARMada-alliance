Hi, I'm DeCentN2Madness, also known as Alice. My partner DeZinerly and I started the Adaberry Pi Cardano stake pool as our research says this blockchain has the best chance to change the world for the better.

As a complementary design and development team, our sleeping giant of a partnership has been awakened by probabilities found within the Cardano NFT and dApp spaces. Being able to pay it forward through OneTreePlanted is a gift to both ourselves and Earth.

We have some exciting NFT drops planned for our delegators and hope you'll join us.
