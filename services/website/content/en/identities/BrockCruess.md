Hi, my name is Brock, I'm a photographer who mints on Cardano and a member of the LMNL art collective.
LMNL is forming an artist residency program designed to onboard artists to the Cardano ecosystem, coach them through the basics of setting up their first wallet, getting their work minted on-chain, and the basics of marketing on-chain art.
I started RTIST Pool as a way to fund a treasury wallet that can be used to purchase the first mints of new Cardano artists who have been onboarded by LMNL.
As added incentive for delegators, those art pieces will then be airdropped to delegators.
This helps the artist get a peer-reviewed price point set on their work, and helps art spread through more Cardano wallets!
