title: Marshall
description: Marshall is an NFT artist that utilizes Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) as the medium to create his works. Fundamentally, he uses the physics of fluid flow, along with flow visualization techniques to create art. His work is the perfect marriage between the fixed laws of physics and the constantly evolving imaginative mind. He likes to inject fun into his works as well, evident in his 'How-Aerodynamic-is-My...' project, where he makes customized works for people.
