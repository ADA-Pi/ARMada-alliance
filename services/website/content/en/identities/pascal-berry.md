Hi, my name is Pascal and I'm the co-operator of Berry Pool. Based in Alma, Canada, I work as an Avionic Technician. Having a developer background and being attracted by the scholar approach of Cardano, I began building my Raspberry Pi stake pool on the Incentivized Testnet (ITN). This journey eventually led me to meet Alessandro.

We agreed on merging our respective pools in december 2020 and I'm now fully committed to help him fulfill his decentralization vision the best I can.

Other than that, I brew delicious beer and love building things with my own hands!

If you want to support us or if decentralization really matters to you, simply delegate to [Berry](/en/stake-pools/2a748e3885f6f73320ad16a8331247b81fe01b8d39f57eec9caa5091.md).
