Hi, I'm Manuel from Barcelona, former Business Intelligence consultant
for a big food company.

SN₳KE Pool is a single stakepool running since first Shelley Cardano Epoch.
It's hosted on a cloud infrastructure, I'm proud to run our pool on NixOS, 
a very powerful Linux distribution.

I love the idea of decentralisation on both technological and ethical perspectives.

Aside of stakepool activity, I'm certified Cardano Developer Professional
with Emurgo Academy.

I'm currently taking the Cardano Solution Architect course, since I would like to go
full blown dApps developer.
