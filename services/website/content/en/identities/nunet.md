Currently, the global computing ecosystem is fragmented and oligopolistic, large infrastructure providers
dominate, and computational resources at the edge of networks are underutilized. NuNetâ€™s interoperability
framework will enable an efficient distribution of diverse computational processes across a distributed and
scalable network of individually owned hardware devices, IoT infrastructures, and data-centers. Connecting
together different marketplaces for computing resources, Nunet will provide an easy to access and uniform
ecosystem powered by a decentralized economy of crypto incentives.

## NuNet will:

- Power the economy of decentralized computing
  marketplaces leveraging advances in micropayment ecosystems,
  distributed computing and blockchain technologies;
- Allow anybody to share, monetize and utilize the value of their
  storage, computing capacities, algorithms, code, data, human
  creativity and machine intelligence, at scale.
- Integrate the world's computing, storage resources
  and data into one meta-marketplace with the help of powerful
  and evolving API of APIs, multi-token micropayment adaptors
  and specialized network operations agents.
