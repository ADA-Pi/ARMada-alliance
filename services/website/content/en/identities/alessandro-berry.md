Hi, my name is Alessandro and I'm the operator of Berry Pool. I'm from Germany and I study computer science at LMU Munich. The cryptocurrency space I've joined back in mid-2018 and I've been involved in Cardano since the end of 2019.

A Raspberry Pi is a powerful resource, which could help with the decentralization of the Cardano ecosystem. One of my goals is to make the onboarding process for people, who want to run a stakepool on a Raspberry Pi, as easy as possible by providing tutorials and useful scripts.

If you want to support us or decentralization really matters to you, simply delegate to [Berry](/en/stake-pools/2a748e3885f6f73320ad16a8331247b81fe01b8d39f57eec9caa5091.md).
