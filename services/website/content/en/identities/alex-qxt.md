Hi, my name is Alex Moreno and I am the Stake Pool Operator of Quixote Dream Pool [QXT]. I created QXT as a way to further educate myself in crypto/blockchain technology. What I found in Cardano is a community I feel inspired to continue helping and support the education of other’s.

I have always had a passion for the social sciences; following that interest, in the last three years I’ve expanded my knowledge of economics, cryptocurrencies, blockchain and Cardano. I am a true believer of the Second Digital Revolution (Blockchain Revolution) and how this technology will change our lives.

I completed my studies at the University of Madrid, a B.S. in Computer Engineering and a M.S. in Social Anthropology. I live in La Mancha (Spain) and spend my days solving problems, primarily in security systems.
