##

A DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that is self-govern and financially sustainable by its tokenomics, protocol, and community of users.

***Basics-***

- Member-owned communities without centralized leadership.
- A safe way to collaborate with internet strangers.
- A safe place to commit funds to a specific cause.

There is not centralized authority, no single person who authorizes when and where the funds of the organization should be spent on, everything is run on top of a blockchain like Ethereum or Cardano to utilize both the immutable ledger and smart contract functionalities of its parent blockchain. By doing this there can exist a since of democratic autonomy to an organizations governance of its management structure by allowing all participants in the community to take part in the governance of the organization and its profits.
