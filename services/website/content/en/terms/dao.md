##

A DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that is self-govern and financially sustainable by its tokenomics, protocol, and community of users.

***Basics-***

- Member-owned communities without centralized leadership.
- A safe way to collaborate with internet strangers.
- A safe place to commit funds to a specific cause.

There is no centralized authority, no single person who authorizes when and where funds from the organization are to be allocated. DAO's run on top of a smart-contract capable blockchain like Ethereum or Cardano to leverage these decentralized algorithmic control mechanisms known as smart contracts. In a way,  there can exist a feeling of democratic autonomy to organizations, a form of governance to the management structure that allows all participants in a community to have a voice.

By utilizing a 3rd generation blockchain like Cardano, DAO's can build a suite of services in the form of [decentralized applications](/en/terms/dapp.md) similar to what we see today on the Ethereum blockchain with [Maker Dao](/en/identities/maker-dao.md). These services may be in the form of a borrowing and lending DeFi application, governance, or voting application, insurance, NFT platforms, and much more.
