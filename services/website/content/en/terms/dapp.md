Decentralized applications or DApps are essentially the same as software applications or Apps you use every day. Unlike centralized applications often used today, for example, Facebook, a DApp has no central authority and control of its user's data. It achieves this decentralized autonomy by using various smart contracts running on a blockchain network. Smart contracts control and run the DApps in the backend while the end-user has a UI to interact with the smart contracts. 

DApps often pay users in the form of a cryptocurrency or token for using their application. The tokens are able to be traded or swapped for other cryptocurrencies or even back to fiat in some cases. Users can also vote on improvements to the smart contracts via these tokens and thus adds a sort of governance to the management of the overall DApp. The most extensive use case currently for DApps exists on the Ethereum blockchain DeFi or decentralized finance ecosystem. 

However, blockchains like Cardano are close to rolling out their own smart contract functionality after entering the Goguen era later this fall in 2021. Here is a list of popular use cases for DApps currently:
- Lending and Borrowing
- Token swaps
- Trading and prediction markets
- Investments
- Trading and prediction markets
- Payments
- Crowdfunding
- Portfolios
- Insurance
- Non Fungible Tokens

Cardano has plans for extending the use cases for smart contracts and decentralized applications even further. Currently, the Cardano ecosystem already has a plethora of uses cases being developed for the network, ranging from [NFT platforms](/en/identities/spacebudz.md) to [world mobile](https://worldmobiletoken.com/) attempting to bring the internet to people around the world to [identity management](https://atalaprism.io/) systems for Countries and governments like Ethiopia. Take a look here at the Cardano ecosystem at its current state:
