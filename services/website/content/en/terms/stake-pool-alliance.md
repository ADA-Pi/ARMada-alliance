##

A stake pool operator is a person or entity that is responsible for operating a stake pool 24/7 365 days a year on the Cardano blockchain. A stake pool alliance is simply a close association of stake pool operators formed to advance common interests or causes. For example the Armada Alliance is an alliance of single stake pool operators that are working together to enhance true decentralization on the Cardano blockchain by using low-power ARM based computers like the [Raspberry Pi](/en/identities/raspberrypi.md).
