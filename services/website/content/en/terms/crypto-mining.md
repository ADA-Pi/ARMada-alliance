The work performed by miners consists of a few main actions:

1. Verifying and validating new transactions
2. Collecting those transactions and ordering them into a new block
3. Adding the block to the ledgerâ€™s chain of blocks (the blockchain)
4. Broadcasting the new block to the cryptocurrency node network
