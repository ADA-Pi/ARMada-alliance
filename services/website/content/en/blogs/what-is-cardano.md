## What is Cardano?

The Cardano blockchain was created in 2015by [IOG](/en/terms/iog.md), the [Cardano Foundation](/en/terms/cardano-foundation.md), and the massive Cardano community.

## What is ADA?

## How to mine ADA?

- Unlike proof-of-work cryptocurrency for example Bitcoin, Cardano's native token ADA is not [mined](/en/terms/crypto-mining.md).

  Instead, Cardano uses a [proof-of-stake](/en/terms/proof-of-stake.md) system to distribute rewards and create new ADA by validating [blocks](/en/terms/block.md).
