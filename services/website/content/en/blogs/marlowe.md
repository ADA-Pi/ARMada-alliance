## Critical Modules in DeFi

### Decentralized exchanges (DEX)

Automated market makers (AMM)

Able to create a market for a particular asset, and then automatically settle the market at a particular price.

- Bonding curves
- Risk-adjusted bonding curves
- Swaps
- Liquidity pools

#### Bonding curves

Is essentially a mathematical function that determines the price of a token in respect to another token.

- Most common AMM today
- Most simple of all

#### Risk-adjusted bonding curves

A bonding curve with a prediction market moduled to take into account the risk of the market.

- Especially useful in the field of social impact finance

#### Swaps

The reasons why there are AMM are:

- Ability exchange tokens for other tokens (swap)

#### Liquidity pools

Pools that contain many different tokens, and can be used to create a market for any token.

### Other price discovery mechanisms

Ways of determining the price of a token:

- Actions
- Appraisals

### Lending & credit

- Path to financial inclusion
- Bank the unbanked
- One of the challenges with lending & credit is the risk of overcollateralization

### Stablecoins

Lending & credit happens over a larger timeframe. With a larger timeframe it's important to have a relatively stable price. Stablecoins are a way to do this.

### Oracles & prediction markets

- External data sources that have to be reliable and have high integrity
- Oracles are a core requirement for stablecoins
- Prediction markets are a core requirement for stablecoins
- Prediction markets are multi-use enhancers; particulary useful in decentralized social impact financing

### Asset fractionalization

- Renew interest with the rise of NFT's

### Margin trading & leverage

### Balancing system

- Particularly important in PoS systems with multiple incentive schemes
- Eg. in a DEX that offers both liquidity mining and validator rewards
