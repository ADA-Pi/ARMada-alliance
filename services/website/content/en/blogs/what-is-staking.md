title: What is [staking](/en/terms/staking.md)?
description: On the [Cardano](/en/terms/cardano.md) blockchain, the ada held by wallets represents the stake in the network; the ability to use your stake to either [pledge](/en/terms/pledge.md) or delegate is one of the core elements of Cardano.

The total staked ada currently in Cardano Stake Pools is around 32.5 billion or 71% of the total supply of ada. This amount of stake is impressive for two reasons it shows the faith that the community has in Cardano, and secondly, it signifies the security of the Cardano network. 

## Why should you delegate your [ada](/en/terms/ada.md)? 

By delegating your ada to a Cardano Stake Pool, you will support the community, benefit from the rewards sharing scheme, and help to secure the overall network. 

Delegating is a great way to be a part of the overall Cardano community that is active, engaged, and working together every day to shape the future of decentralization. Choosing a Stake Pool that aligns with your interest can improve Cardano by supporting them and their missions with the delegation of your stake. Many Stake Pool operators are active on social media, youtube, and forums to engage with their community of delegators.

While you are delegating with the pool of your choice, you will take part in the [rewards sharing scheme](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11218) of Cardano and be paid on average by a well-performing stake pool around 5% APY on your total stake. On top of this reward, many stake pools offer NFT/token airdrops, ada dividends, and services. 

Security of the Cardano network through pledge and delegation is another benefit of Cardano's groundbreaking Ouroboros PoS and Consensus mechanism research. Proof-of-stake blockchains like Cardano use a virtual resource or stake to achieve consensus on the blockchain. The stake is recorded on the blockchain's ledger as a native token (ada).

Not to go into too many technicals, but due to Cardano PoS design and the enormous amount of ada staked, it is capable of defending off many attacks like:
- 51% Attack
- [Sybil Attack](/en/terms/sybil-attack.md)
- Fake Stake Attack
