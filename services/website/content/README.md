```

### Identity Roles

There's currently two roles available that can be given to people contributing to a page.

- `author` — This is the person that has created the post and has done the most work on it. This can be multiple people working on a post equally.
- `editor` — This is the person that has edited the post to improve it's grammar slightly or added other small improvements to the post. 

Per template different metadata properties are supported:

Term: aliases (names the term also is known as)

## Templates

We will support different templates for pages, based on the template defined the page will be rendered using a different template.

## Translations

The original page will always be the english page. Whenever you add a translation you can add a directory with the name of that language `en`, `de`, `es` etc. In order to refer back to the original (english page) you can add metadata refering back to the english page.


/es/a-blog-post-title-in-spanish.md
```

template: BlogDetailPage
title: A blog post title in Spanish
source: /en/a-blog-post-title-in-english.md
