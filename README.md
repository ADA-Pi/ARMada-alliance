# Armada Alliance Website

https://armada-alliance.com

## Our Mission

- The Armada alliance was formed in efforts to build a community of decentralized, low-cost, and energy-efficient stake pool operations on Cardano. All Stake Pools that are apart of this alliance run on either Raspberry Pis exclusively or low power consuming ARM-based machines.

## How to add your pool (and stake pool operators) to the website

1. Fork this repo with your GitHub account

2. Add a file named `<IDENTITY_ID>.md` for every stake pool operator of your stake pool inside https://github.com/armada-alliance/armada-alliance/tree/main/services/website/content/en/identities

3. Add a file named <POOL_ID>.md for your pool inside https://github.com/armada-alliance/armada-alliance/tree/main/services/website/content/en/stake-pools

4. Head back to the armada-alliance github and submit a pull request to add your pool to the website

Hi I am Wael Ivie, the founder of the Armada Alliance and the ARMing Cardano proposal from fund4 of project Catalyst. My whole life I have been wondering how can I help the world be a better place? I have decided to do this by focusing my efforts on decentralization and blockchain education.
