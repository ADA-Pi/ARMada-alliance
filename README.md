Armada Alliance registry + website

## Our Mission
- The Armada alliance was formed in efforts to build a community of decentralized, low-cost, and energy-efficient stake pool operations on Cardano. All Stake Pools that are apart of this alliance run on either **Raspberry Pis exclusively or low power consuming ARM-based machines.**

## How to add your pool to the registry

1. Fork this repo with your GitHub account

2. Add a file named `<YOUR_TICKER>.json` to the registry directory.

3. Head back to the armada-allaince github and submit a pull request to add your pool to the registry

#### Here is an example of a pool's registration JSON file. (Note: Only ticker and poolId fields are required to be filled in)
