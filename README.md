# Armada-Alliance
Armada Alliance registry + website

https://armada-alliance.com

## Our Mission
- The Armada alliance was formed in efforts to build a community of decentralized, low-cost, and energy-efficient stake pool operations on Cardano. All Stake Pools that are apart of this alliance run on either Raspberry Pis exclusively or low power consuming ARM-based machines.

## How to add your pool to the registry

Add a file named `<YOUR_TICKER>.json` to the registry directory.

#### Here is an example of a pool's registration JSON file.
```json
{
    "ticker": "PIADA",
    "poolId": "b8d8742c7b7b512468448429c776b3b0f824cef460db61aa1d24bc65",
